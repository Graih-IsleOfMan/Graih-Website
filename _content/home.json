  "introParagraph": "We are a Christian charity, based in Douglas in the Isle of Man - though we work all over the Island. We are here to help people who are in insecure accomodation and those affected by homelessness. Graih offers a range of services including a **Drop-In Centre**, **Community Support** and an **Emergency Night Shelter**.\n\nGraih adopts a non-judgemental approach to addressing homelessness issues. We believe in a person-centred approach, supporting individuals from 18 years of age up, building on peoples strengths and their potential. We try to respond to individuals with compassion, kindness and support putting dignity and respect at the centre of all we do.\n\nAs well as our support work, we also act as a voice for change on the Island, working with others around transformation in the areas of homelessness and housing.\n\n**Please note:** If you are in crisis, please contact the **Crisis Response Team on: +44 1624 642860**. This service operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nIf you need the **Emergency Services, please call 999.**",
