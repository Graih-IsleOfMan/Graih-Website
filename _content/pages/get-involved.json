Volunteers get to spend time with our guests - from providing a warm welcome to helping serve the teas / coffees and lunch. Due to the unpredictable nature of the Drop-In, It can mean that sometimes we only have one or two guests through our doors - right through to overflowing.\n\nThe role of a volunteer is to serve and contribute to keeping everything peaceful.\n\nIf you are interested in volunteering and want more information, or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our volunteer co-ordinator: Yvette Armstrong ([yvette@graih.org.im](mailto:yvette@graih.org.im)). All new volunteers will be given an induction before they start and will be required to have undergone a DBS check.",
